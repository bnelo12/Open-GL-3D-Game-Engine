## Update 1

I am documententing my progress to create a modern OpenGL game engine. Before deciding to post my results on GitHub, I had created a simple Phong shader for the lighting model, and the ability to apply different shaders to different objects. I have three primitives in the primitive class: cube, sphere, and plane. I will attach a screen shot of my progress with each merge to the master branch.
